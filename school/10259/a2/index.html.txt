            <h3>The Raspberry Pi</h3>
            <img src="images/pi.jpg" alt="Raspberry Pi logo" id="rPi">
            <p>"The Raspberry Pi Foundation is a UK-based charity that works to put the power of computing and digital making into the hands
                of people all over the world. We do this so that more people are able to harness the power of computing and digital
                technologies for work, to solve problems that matter to them, and to express themselves creatively."
            </p>
            <p>From <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/about/">www.raspberrypi.org</a></p>
            <p>While the Raspberry Pi Foundation promotes the education and use of these IoT devices, the Raspberry Pi computer is made by the
                commercial arm.  It is available for purchase from Amazon and many other computer retailers.
            </p>
            <p>Some Raspberry Pi websites:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://magpi.raspberrypi.com/">MagPi</a> - the official Raspberry Pi magazine.  Tons of how-to articles, reviews,
                        and projects
                </li>
                <li><a href="https://twisteros.com/">TwisterOS</a> - an operating system based on Raspberry Pi OS, comes preloaded with tons of
                    software, including RetroPi gaming.  It's a heavy distribution, and gets both a lot of love and a lot of hate.
                </li>
                <li><a href="https://shopmakergenix.blogspot.com/2021/07/windows-11-on-raspberry-pi-devices-in.html?m=1">How to run
                    Windows 11 on a Raspberry Pi.</a>  It works, but it's not good.  Video drivers don't support 4K, no audio driver.
                </li>
                <li><a href="https://pi-hole.net/">Pi-Hole</a> - An ad-blocker that runs on a Raspberry Pi and offers tons of configuration options</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Mining cryptocurrency</h3>
            <p>This is something I have tried to play around with, but on a day-to-day basis I don't do it.  It is simply not economically feasable
                unless you have powerful computers that can solve the problems quickly.
            </p>

            <p>(See the tie-in to the previous interest?)</p>
            <p>Network Chuck, shown in the video above, is a rather click-baity reviewer.  He is someone with good advice, but is more of a
                self-promoter than a creator of truly useful content.  Nevertheless, he often does have entertaining content, like this video.
            </p>
            <p>Mining on a Raspberry Pi is an excercise in futility, as you won't make enough money to even cover your electricity costs.
                0/10 not recommended for usefullness, 10/10 recommended for fun and learning about basic mining!
