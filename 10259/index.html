				<h3>A little bit about me...</h3>
				<p>I have worked in IT for about 30 years, and I've wanted to go back to school to become a programmer.  Programming has always been my passion, and my previous jobs have always included a little bit of programming.</p>
				<p>I've studied, at Seneca College, C, C++, and C#.  I've forgotten almost everything about C and C++, having used C# exclusive since it was released.</p>
				<p>I learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JQuery on my own over the past few years, but as you know, you don't learn the <em>proper</em> way always when you are self-taught.</p>
				<p>I learned a lot last year in HTML/CSS, and I hope to learn a lot this semester.  I am not a designer, and have no ambition to be one, but I hope my pages aren't too ugly.</p>
